What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when I initialize a repository a .git file is created and it becomes a git repository.
It is necessary so as to use all the git functions and commit changes to the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It helps in adding commits to a separate repository easily.
